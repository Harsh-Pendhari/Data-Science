# NumPy

This folder contains hands-on Python scripts covering core **NumPy** concepts required for data science and machine learning. The focus is on understanding **array-based computation**, **vectorized operations**, and **efficient numerical workflows**, rather than exhaustive or academic coverage.

The topics included here form the practical NumPy foundation used throughout **data analysis**, **Pandas operations**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and **machine learning pipelines**.

---

## Topics Covered

- NumPy array creation and fundamentals  
- One-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays  
- Indexing, slicing, and boolean masking  
- Scalar arithmetic and vectorized operations  
- Comparison operations  
- Broadcasting rules and usage  
- Aggregate functions (`sum`, `mean`, `min`, `max`, etc.)  
- Array filtering and conditional selection  
- Random number generation for simulations and data sampling  

---

## Purpose

The objective of this folder is to:

- Build intuition for array-oriented programming  
- Enable efficient data manipulation and computation  
- Serve as a foundation for Pandas, EDA, and ML workflows  

Advanced NumPy internals are intentionally excluded, as they are not required at this stage of data science learning.

---

## Notes

- Scripts are organized progressively by concept  
- Each file focuses on practical usage with examples  
- Concepts such as reshaping, axis operations, and NaN handling are included within relevant scripts  

---

## Status

✅ **Completed** — sufficient for data science progression
