# Data Science Learning Repository

This repository showcases my structured and hands-on journey into Data Science using Python. It is designed as a progressive learning portfolio, emphasizing practical implementation, clean code, and real-world data handling rather than abstract theory.

The objective is to build a strong foundation in data analysis and machine learning while maintaining professional coding standards and clear documentation.
